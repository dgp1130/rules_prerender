# Internal Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the internals and infrastructure of
`@rules_prerender`. This is intended for maintainers and contributors to the
project, _not_ end users of it.

End user documentation is coming in
https://github.com/dgp1130/rules_prerender/issues/16.

Of course, everyone is free to read and learn. However keep in mind that
everything here should be treated as _implementation details_, not a public API
contract. Just because `@rules_prerender` works a certain way today, does not
imply that it will work that way in tomorrow's patch release. Think carefully
before you depend on any detail you read here.
