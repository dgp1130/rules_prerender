# Examples

These are a list of example applications and projects using `rules_prerender`.

These exist partially to serve as test cases to prevent regressions, and
partially as "documentation by example". Most of them are pretty small and
exercise a specific feature to verify that it works. [site/](site/) is an
example of a non-trivial web site and is the best reference if that is what
you're looking for.
