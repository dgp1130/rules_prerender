# Multi-Page

An example which generates multiple pages from a single NodeJS tool using
`prerender_multi_page_bundled()`. In this particular example, the pages are
fairly trivial and have constant paths, but the same strategy could be used to
generate pages from a more dynamic set of inputs, like a list of markdown files
that get converted into corresponding HTML files.
