Here is one more blog post about nothing in particular because I can't come up
with anything clever to say. These posts are sorted alphabetically, so who
clicks on the middle post? Do you not believe that all these posts are generated
from markdown like a real blog? Or are you just a rebel who refuses to click on
the first post because that's what "the man" would want you to do? I can respect
that.
