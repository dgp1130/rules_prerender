# Site

This example builds a non-trivial web site with `rule_prerender`. Most examples
focus on a specific feature and just show how to use that, however this example
acts as a full use case of building a web site. The site contents are somewhat
contrived but should use realistic enough patterns to act as a stand-in and
example of a real web site you might see on the internet.
