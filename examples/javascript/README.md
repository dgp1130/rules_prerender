# JavaScript

An example which uses JavaScript source files (as opposed to TypeScript) to
render a component and execute client-side scripts.

This example uses CommonJS to load dependencies, but it should be possible to
use ESM with the right Node version and configuration. Doing so is not fully
tested or supported however.
