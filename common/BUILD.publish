# This file exists simply so this directory is considered a Bazel package and
# references to `//common:label.bzl` will resolve correctly. Without this file,
# it would need to be `//:common/label.bzl`, meaning paths would be different
# between the local build of `rules_prerender` and user code loading this
# through `rules_nodejs` and the `@npm` workspace.
