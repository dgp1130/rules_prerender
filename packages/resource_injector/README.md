# Resource Injector

Takes an HTML file and a configuration JSON file which lists out types of
resources (JavaScript, CSS) to inject into the HTML page. Outputs a new HTML
page identical to the input, but with the resources included. This is a useful
tool for inserting `<script />` and `<style />` tags into a page.
